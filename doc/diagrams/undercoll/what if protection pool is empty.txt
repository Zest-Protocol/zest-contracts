note over Vault Contract:If more borrowers default, keep\nrecalculating interest until interest hits a\npercentage close to 0 as defined by governance
Vault Contract-#blue>Vault Contract:calculate_interest_structure

==If interest hits this number, the pool goes in default mode==
==No new loans & roll-overs can be made, the pool is closed and we wait until all loans have been paid off==
==If further borrower defaults happen during this period that push interest negative,\nthe protocol will auction govtokens staked in the safety module for native BTC to compensate affected lenders.==
